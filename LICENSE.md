My intent is to make Firefox the best browser. I do not want Tab Tosser to be made available for Chrome because [Google’s predominant business model is unethical][1]. I do not want Tab Tosser to be made available for Chromium-powered browsers because [the Web as a platform is harmed by a browser monoculture][2]. For good reasons, no [OSI-approved license][3] permits me to have this soapbox.

I cannot accept pull requests due to the legal complexities of contribution assignment.
